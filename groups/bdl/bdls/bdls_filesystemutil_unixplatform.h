//@PURPOSE: Provide Unix timstamp and offset type width detection macros.
//
//@MACROS:
// BDLS_FILESYSTEMUTIL_UNIXPLATFORM_64_BIT_OFF:   1 if 'off_t' is 64 bits, else
// BDLS_FILESYSTEMUTIL_UNIXPLATFORM_64_BIT_OFF64: 1 if 'off64_t' exists, else
// BDLS_FILESYSTEMUTIL_UNIXPLATFORM_32_BIT_OFF:   1 ('off_t' is 32 bits)
//
// BDLS_FILESYSTEMUTIL_UNIXPLATFORM_STAT_NS_MEMBER:   The 'stat' nanosecond
//                                                    member name
//
//@SEE_ALSO: bdls_filesystemutil, bdls_filesystemutil_unixplatform,

//
//@DESCRIPTION: This subordinate component to 'bdls_filesystemutil' provides:
//
// a) a set of macros for detecting the most appropriate type to use for byte
// quantities, and most appropriate set of functions to use for file
// operations, on Unix platforms, and
//
// b) a macro which specifies the name of the member variable, within a 'stat'
// structure, that holds the nanosecond part of the file timestamp.
//
///Nanosecond Support Macros
///-------------------------
// This component defines the following Macros if the 'stat' structure defined
// in 'sys/stat.h' contains the 'st_mtim.tv_nsec' member.  This is determined
// by the feature tests specified in POSIX.1-2008 - see
// https://linux.die.net/man/2/fstat.
//
//: 'BDLS_FILESYSTEMUTIL_UNIXPLATFORM_STAT_NS_MEMBER': This macro is defined to
//:  be the name of the member of the 'stat' structure that contains the
//:  nanosecond part of the timestamp value.
//
///Byte Quantity Macros
///--------------------
// This component defines exactly 1 of 3 macros depending on the current
// platform configuration, which are used to determine which offset type and
// associated set of file-system functions a program should use on Unix.  These
// macros are:
//
//: 'BDLS_FILESYSTEMUTIL_UNIXPLATFORM_64_BIT_OFF': The presence of this macro
//: definition indicates that the platform natively supports large (64-bit)
//: file operations, and that the 'off_t' type provided by the 'sys/types.h'
//: header is 64-bit.
//:
//: 'BDLS_FILESYSTEMUTIL_UNIXPLATFORM_64_BIT_OFF64': The presence of this macro
//: definition indicates that the platform *does* *not* natively support large
//: (64-bit) file operations, but that it does support the
//: "transitional-compilation environment" that provides non-standard large
//: file types and operations.  Specifically, this indicates that the platform
//: supports a 64-bit 'off64_t' type, and provides associated 'xxx64' file
//: operations.  For more information about the transitional-complation
//: environment, see the component documentation of
//: {'bdls_filesystemutil_transitionaluniximputil'}.
//:
//: 'BDLS_FILESYSTEMUTIL_UNIXPLATFORM_32_BIT_OFF': The presence of this macro
//: definition indicates that the platform does not natively support large
//: (64-bit) file operations, nor is it configured to provide the
//: transitional-compilation environment.  Specifically, this indicates that
//: the platform provides a 32-bit 'off_t' type and associated 32-bit file
//: operations.  If this macro is defined, a program may be unable to operate
//: on files larger than approximately 2 Gigabytes.
//
///Byte Quantity Macro Selection
///-----------------------------
// Which of the 3 macros this component defines depends upon the capabilities
// of the platform's configuration.  There are 4 criteria used to determine
// which macro is defined, and they are
//
//: o the operating system,
//: o whether the cpu is 32 or 64-bit,
//: o whether a '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS' macro is defined to '64', and
//: o whether the transitional-compilation environment is enabled
//
// The set of possible combinations of these critera, and consequently which
// macros are defined, is specified in the table below.  The legend for this
// table is the following:
//
//: 'OS':
//:   Short for "Operating System".  This column lists the operating system
//:   associated with the platform.
//:
//: 'Mode':
//:   Either '32' or '64'.  This column lists the number of bits in a machine
//:   word associated with the platform.  A program compiled for an x86
//:   processor would be '32', and one compiled for an x86_64 processor would
//:   be '64', for example.
//:
//: 'FOB=64':
//:   Short for "File-Offset Bits == 64".  This column lists whether or not the
//:   '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS' macro is defined to the value '64', or is otherwise
//:   defined to another value or undefined.  A value of 'Yes' indicates
//:   '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS' is defined to '64', and a value of 'No' indicates
//:   that it is not.  Note that this macro is not a part of any Unix standard,
//:   but nevertheless is supported by several Unixes.  On most Unix platforms,
//:   defining '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS' to a value other than '64' has no meaning.
//:
//: 'LF':
//:   Short for 'Large File Source'.  This column lists whether or not a macro
//:   is defined that indicates the current program is compiled in the
//:   "Transitional-Compilation Environment."  A value of 'Yes' indicates the
//:   transitional-compilation environment is enabled, and a value of 'No'
//:   indicates that it is not.  Different macros enable this environment on
//:   different Unixes, if they support it.  This environment is enabled on AIX
//:   if the '_LARGE_FILE' macro is defined, and it is enabled on Linux,
//:   Solaris, and SunOS if the '_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE' macro is defined.
//:   Neither Cygwin, Darwin, nor FreeBSD support this environment, because
//:   they natively support large (64-bit) file operations in all compilation
//:   modes.
//:
//: 'Off Type':
//:   Short for "Offset Type".  This column lists the type that a program
//:   should use to represent file offsets on Unix platforms.  The offset type
//:   should be 'off_t' (64-bit) if the program natively supports large
//:   (64-bit) file operations, 'off64_t' if the program does not natively
//:   support these operations, but provides the transitional-compilation
//:   environment, and 'off_t' (32-bit) if the program neither natively support
//:   large (64-bit) file operations nor provides the transitional-compilation
//:   environment.  Note that a 32-bit 'off_t' is used as a "last resort" when
//:   no 64-bit offset type is available on the platform.  A program may be
//:   unable to operate on files larger than approximately 2 Gigabytes if a
//:   32-bit 'off_t' is used.
//:
//: 'Off Bits':
//:   This column lists the number of bits used in the offset type to represent
//:   a byte quantity.  A value of '64' indicates that the offset type has 64
//:   bits, and a value of '32' indicates that the offset type has 32 bits.
//:
//: 'Macro Defined':
//:   This column lists which macro provided by this component is defined, in
//:   order to indicate the offset type and set of file-system functions that a
//:   program should use on Unix.  A value of '*_32_BIT_OFF' indicates that the
//:   'BDLS_FILESYSTEMUTIL_UNIXPLATFORM_32_BIT_OFF' macro is defined, and that
//:   a program should use the 'off_t' offset type and associated file-system
//:   functions, a value of "*_64_BIT_OFF" indicates that the
//:   'BDLS_FILESYSTEMUTIL_UNIXPLATFORM_64_BIT_OFF' macro is defined, and that
//:   a program should use the 'off_t' offset type and associated file-system
//:   tunctions, and a value of '*_64_BIT_OFF64' indicates that the
//:   'BDLS_FILESYSTEMUTIL_UNIXPLATFORM_64_BIT_OFF64' macro is defined, and
//:   that a program should use the 'off64_t' offset type, and associated
//:   file-system functions from the transitional-compilation environment.
//
// The table follows.  Note that a value of 'N/A' in any cell of the table
// indicates that the value of that cell does affect the determination of the
// value of the associated 'Off Type', 'Off-Type Bits' and 'Macro Defined'
// cells.
